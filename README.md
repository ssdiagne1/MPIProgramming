# MPIProgramming

Welcome to the MPIProgramming repository! This project is focused on implementing a dynamic workload partitioning scheme in MPI, specifically utilizing the Master-Worker paradigm. The implementation involves a combination of shell scripts, C, and C++ programming languages. The project primarily operates in a Linux environment.

## Overview

The MPIProgramming application is designed to efficiently distribute computational workloads among multiple processing units using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard. The Master-Worker model enables parallel execution of tasks, enhancing performance and scalability for computationally intensive applications.

## Features

- Dynamic Workload Partitioning: The application dynamically distributes computational tasks among MPI processes for optimal resource utilization.
- Shell Scripts: Utilize shell scripts for automation, setup, and orchestration of MPI-based computations.
- C and C++ Implementation: Leverage the power of C and C++ programming languages for high-performance computing and data processing.
- Plot Generation: Generate plots and visual representations of computational results for analysis and interpretation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the MPIProgramming application, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Linux Environment: The application is designed to run on a Linux operating system.
2. MPI Library: Install the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library on your system. Common MPI implementations include Open MPI and MPICH.
3. C/C++ Compiler: Ensure a compatible C/C++ compiler is installed on your system.

## Installation

To use the MPIProgramming application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ssdiagne1/MPIProgramming.git
    ```

2. Compile the MPI programs using the appropriate compiler and MPI implementation. Refer to the provided build instructions or Makefile for guidance.

3. Ensure necessary input data and configuration files are available for execution.

## Usage

Once the MPIProgramming project is set up and compiled, you can:

1. Execute the shell scripts to orchestrate the execution of MPI programs and manage computational tasks.

2. Monitor the progress of computations and analyze generated results.

3. Explore the provided C and C++ source code to understand the underlying implementation of the dynamic workload partitioning scheme.
